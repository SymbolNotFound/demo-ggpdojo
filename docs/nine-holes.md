# Tic-Tac-Classic (Nine Holes)

Also known as *Three Men's Morris*, see also very close variants in *Achi*
(four pieces per player), *Shisima* (octagonal board) and *Dara* (larger 6x5
board, play does not terminate with the first line but continues with captures).
In *Tant fant* the drop phase is removed, all pieces start on a player's side.
A variant of *Tant fant* also requires lines to be diagonal and not horizontal
or vertical.

*Nine Holes* does not restrict movement, whereas the close variants require
that movement actions be done to adjacent positions only.

## Board and Equipment

A three by three rectangular grid.  In the Nine Holes variant this can be a
peg-and-hole arrangement (or a ring and pole arrangement) which have no
connections drawn between positions.  If other variants are also available for
play (perhaps as a selection of rules done by the first player, the one who
chose the game), then boards with the horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines
drawn on them would be preferred.

For equipment, each player has three (or four) pieces that can be placed on
a position of the baord.

## Legal player actions

Play proceeds in two phases:

1. *drop phase* - each player alternates turns placing their piece on an open
position of the board.

2. *move phase* - each player moves one of their pieces to any (or adjacent)
position of the board.

## Terminal condition

The game is over when a player forms a three in a row of their own pieces.  The
game may end in a draw if neither player wants to continue, or if the same piece
arrangement is seen a third time.

## Goal payouts

The player who forms a three-in-a-row wins the entire stake.
